## RPG Battle
##### A python implementation of a text based/terminal battle game

## This project is not maintained and was created to serve as an illustration of python.  No patches will be committed to this repository.

Ended up having to rewrite a good portion of it, so I've improved quite a bit of it.  Now with awesome HP/MP bars, multiple enemies and party members, and items.
